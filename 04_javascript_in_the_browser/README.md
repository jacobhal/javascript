# Section 4: DOM Manipulation and Events

## DOM Manipulation
Interacting with a webpage's content through JavaScript is called DOM manipulation.  
DOM stands for Document Object Model which is a structured representation of a HTML document. DOM is an object-oriented representation of the webpage content.

## Events
**Events** are notifications that are sent to notify the code that something happened on the webpage.  
Examples: clicking a button, resizing a window, scrolling down/up or pressing a key.

> An Event can only be processed as soon as the Execution Stack is empty (all functions have returned).

Events that happen in the browser are put in a *Message queue* and they sit there waiting to be processed.

## Event Listeners
**Event listeners** are functions that perform a certain action based on a certain event. It "listens" for the event to happen.
